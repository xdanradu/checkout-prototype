  <h2>Veni, vidi, vici</h2>
  I came, I saw, I conquered. Famously attributed to Julius Caesar in a message
  he supposedly sent to the Roman Senate to describe his swift, conclusive
  victory against King Pharnaces II of Pontus near Zela in 47 BC.

  <h2>Alea iacta est</h2>
  The die has been cast („zarurile au fost aruncate”). Another Latin phrase said
  by Julius Caesar upon crossing the Rubicon to enter Italy and begin the long
  civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The meaning of this phrase refers
  to the point of no return.

  <h2>Carpe diem</h2>
  Seize the day („traieste clipa”). Probably the most popular Latin phrase of
  modern times. Luckily, we have an even better one: carpe vinum. Literally
  ‘seize the wine’. The only Latin phrase you’ll ever need on a Friday night
  out. And speaking of night, you should also remember the carpe noctem
  variation which literally translates to ‘seize the night’. Either way, the
  general meaning is to make the most of everything.

  <h2>Cogito, ergo sum</h2>
  I think, therefore I am. A dictum (‘a short statement that expresses a general
  truth’) coined by French philosopher René Descartes in Latin. What Descartes
  doesn’t know is that nowadays people prefer the bibo, ergo sum version which
  literally means “I drink, therefore I am”.

  <h2>In vino veritas</h2>
  In wine, there is truth. Be careful if you carpe vinum on that Friday night
  out we talked about. This Latin saying suggests that you’ll probably spill all
  your secrets if you drink too much alcohol.

  <h2>Et tu, Brute?</h2>
  “And you, Brutus?” Or “You too, Brutus?”. This Latin quote appears in William
  Shakespeare’s play “Julius Caesar” at the very moment of Caesar’s
  assassination. Upon recognizing his friend, Marcus Junius Brutus, as one of
  the assassins, Julius Caesar utters these last words. That scene is very
  tragic indeed, but nowadays, the phrase can be used jokingly to condemn a
  friend’s change of heart.

  <h2>Acta, non verba</h2>
  Deeds, not words. Similar to res, non verba, the English equivalent of this
  phrase is “actions speak louder than words”. In other words, act upon it or
  always follow your declarations with actions.

  <h2>Carthago delenda est</h2>
  Carthage must be destroyed. Prior to the Third Punic War between Rome and
  Carthage, Cato the Censor, a Roman politician, used to conclude all his
  speeches to the Senate with this phrase. While he did this in an attempt to
  push for the war, nowadays the expression can be used figuratively as a way to
  express your absolute support for an idea.

  <h2>Verba volant, scripta manent</h2>
  It means "spoken words fly away, written words remain".

  <h2>Quid pro quo</h2>
  Something for something Or ‘this for that’. A favor granted in return for
  something else. Similar to “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”.

  <h2>Deus ex machina</h2>
  God from the machine A plot device used to resolve a seemingly unsolvable
  problem. It’s often considered a lazy or cheap way to tie loose ends in movies
  or books. A good example could be Arya killing the Night King in Game of
  Thrones.

  <h2>Ad hoc</h2>
  For this Or ‘for this purpose. Something that is not planned, but done only
  when it’s needed. An ad hoc meeting. Mea culpa Through my fault An
  acknowledgment of one’s fault or an admission of guilt.

  <h2>Status quo</h2>
  The existing state (of affairs) Mainly used with regard to social or political
  issues. “The officials wanted to maintain the status quo, so they did not vote
  to admit the new members.

  <h2>Per se</h2>
  (and not ‘per say’) By itself or in itself Used to describe or talk about
  something on its own, rather than in connection with other things. “I’m not a
  fan of the Latin language per se, but rather its influence on modern
  languages.”

  <h2>Alma mater</h2>
  Nourishing mother Used to identify the institution of education that one
  formerly attended. It suggests that a school provides intellectual nourishment
  to its students.

  <h2>De facto</h2>
  In fact Describes something existing in fact, although perhaps not legal. It
  contrasts with de jure, which refers to things that happen according to law.

  <h2>Persona non grata</h2>
  An unwelcome person Especially used in diplomacy, but also in day-to-day
  conversations. “Julian is a persona non grata for us since he offended Miriam.

  <h2>Bona fide</h2>
  In good faith If something was made bona fide, then it is sincere, genuine or
  authentic.

  <h2>Sui generis</h2>
  Of its/his/her/their own kind Constituting a class alone. Unique. Think of
  Mozart for example.

  <h2>Sine qua non</h2>
  Without which, not Something absolutely essential. A more clear translation
  could be ‘without (something), (something else) won’t be possible’.
  “Creativity is a sine qua non for writing novels.”

  <h2>Ad infinitum</h2>
  To infinity Unlike the previous Latin words, this one is pretty
  self-explanatory.

  <h2>Et cetera</h2>
  And other similar things Every student’s favorite. We all know what this one
  means, don’t we?
